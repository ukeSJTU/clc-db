## Dataset

All data in CLC-DB is stored in the **data** folder and within the constructed database files.

The files in sdf format are optimized molecule 3D conformations.

## Help of the Online Webserver

CLC-DB constructed an online webserver using the Python-based Django framework, achieving the separation of the front-end and back-end. Details of the database running commands are recorded in the README files of both the **frontend** and **backend** folders.
